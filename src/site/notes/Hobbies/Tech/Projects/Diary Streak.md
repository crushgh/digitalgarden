# Diary Streak

Use Word Counts plugin to get word counts of daily notes - streak is consecutive days above a certain number (110? - this is what calendar is set at).

Or put a Todoist check box at the end of the diary to confirm that it has been completed. 

Also need to get DayOne into Obsidian: [DayOne JSON to Markdown (Obsidian) - Share & showcase - Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/dayone-json-to-markdown-obsidian/28028)
