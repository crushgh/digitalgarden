## Browser

For your PC or Mac, use **Firefox** as your browser. Chrome is created by Google, and collects a large amount of data on you: see [X]. By contrast, Firefox has advanced privacy tools built-in, such as Enhanced Tracking Protection (ETP), and is run by a non-profit, Mozilla. On Mac, Firefox is a lot faster and has better extensions than Safari. 

On your iPhone, Safari is fine (and you can use Privacy Relay if you don't have a VPN) but Firefox and DuckDuckGo also offer their own browsers. 

### In-app browsers 

On mobile, avoid the browsers that display in apps such as Facebook and Instagram: disable or always tap to launch in Safari. [TikTok is the worst]. To see what an in-app browser is tracking, visit inAppBrowser.com from the in-app browser. 

## Search engine

Use **Duck Duck Go** as your default search engine on Mac/PC and iPhone. (How to set that on Firefox | How to set that on iOS).

If you do need to use another search engine, like Google, you can add `!g` or a number of other "interrobangs" [?] in your query and DDG will automatically redirect you. 

## VPN

A VPN is [xx]. Mullvad has the following features:
